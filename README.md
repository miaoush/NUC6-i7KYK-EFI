# NUC6-i7KYK-EFI
Hi this is Sean.

I'm a new man to MacOS.

Lately i want use my NUC6-i7KYK to get MacOS ,but its always error in USB3.0 port.

I can't find any solution when I travelled some BBS like 9tomac and pcbeta.

I found a merchant to solved this and costs me 120 CNY($20).

So me wanna share this EFI folder to avoid another silly me find merchant.
